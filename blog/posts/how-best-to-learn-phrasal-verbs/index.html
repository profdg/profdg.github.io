Most ESL (English as a Second Language) learners will agree that learning phrasal verbs is one of the worst parts of their English journey. We take two (or more) commonly used words, put them together, and now we have what is basically a new word with a completely different meaning! Even worse than that, these new meanings seem illogical considering the two (or sometimes three) words originally used. So that begs the question: How can one best learn phrasal verbs? Truthfully, there are many ways you could go about it, but I would like to propose a different approach.  Let’s get to it! What are Phrasal Verbs? Phrasal Verbs are idiomatic phrases that have a verb (thus the name) and another element which is generally a preposition or an adverb. These then join together to create what is effectively a new word. Phrasal Verbs are extremely common in spoken or casual English. I’d go as far as to say that it’s extremely difficult to talk for 1 minute and not use a phrasal verb. Ironically, we do have vocabulary that mean the same as these phrasal verbs, but these words are generally considered ‘fancy’ or ‘something Shakespeare would say’. Often times, we don’t even know them! These same ‘fancy’ words then happen to exist in other languages almost verbatim, particularly in languages derived from Latin (such as Portuguese), and they are normal, everyday words! So, in summary, English speakers are just making life harder for those trying to learn English. Nice! The current method Until now, most approaches centre around the idea of memorizing phrasal verbs. In my view, this is essentially like learning History back when I was in school. Reading and rereading the information for those few moments in life when I am asked to repeat it again in a test. Outside of those situations, I am unlikely to remember that information. Even more so when from nowhere, I now need to use that information. It’s just lost somewhere in my brain with everything else. Highly unhelpful. To help students, most books try to group phrasal verbs by theme, or maybe a common word (phrasal verbs beginning with ‘put’ for example). This can be helpful, but then we remember that many phrasal verbs can be used in various unrelated contexts, with seemingly different definitions, and confusion takes over. Again, highly unhelpful. So, how do we deal with this? Well, I have a theory. Think outside of the box. Way outside!! The method I propose is a slow one, but ultimately more beneficial with time. When my students are learning phrasal verbs with me, I try to give them a few synonyms for the phrasal verb, and then follow that up with loads of examples. This is because through many examples we can see that, if we really think about it, there is a common thread between the various meanings. Let’s work through one. Break out Here are some seemingly unrelated uses for break out: Britney Spears was a break out star. (Meaning: one day nobody knew of her, the next day she’s world famous) Did you read those criminals broke out of prison? (Meaning: people were captive, and now free when they shouldn’t be) War suddenly broke out in Eastern Europe. (Meaning: something unexpected happened) Now, you may have already seen the common thread there, but in all those situations, something sudden and unexpected happened. Back in 1999, no normal person on the street had any meaningful expectation that a young woman from Mississippi would become a global pop sensation. Nor did anyone expect that Clarence and John Anglin would escape from Alcatraz prison. Finally, in the case of #3 anyway, the world had a belief that war could start in Ukraine, but many didn’t expect it to happen when it did. In all three of those examples, something sudden, and unexpected happened. That is the common idea and the definition of break out. They are really just new words If we begin to think of phrasal verbs really as entirely new words with there own definitions, we will have a far better time learning, and then actually remembering and using them. Yes this can be annoying, and yes the fact that this is even a thing is in many ways silly. But, it is the English language and we need to love it, right? Where to from here? I would now encourage you to go pick another phrasal verb, maybe one you’re not familiar with. Research the different uses of that phrasal verb, and see if you can find that common thread. You may have to think really far outside of the box, and with an open mind, but I’m telling you the common idea is there. Once you know that, it becomes like math: you can apply the equation (phrasal verb in this case) anywhere you want as long as the logic is correct. If the logic of the phrasal verb makes sense in the context you wish to use it, then you can. Do this, and you should never use phrasal verbs incorrectly again!" /><meta property="og:description" content="Let’s be honest for a minute… Phrasal Verbs suck.
