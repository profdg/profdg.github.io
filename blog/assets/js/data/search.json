We take two (or more) commonly used words, put them together, and now we have what is basically a new word with a completely different meaning!Even worse than that, these new meanings seem illogical considering the two (or sometimes three) words originally used.So that begs the question: How can one best learn phrasal verbs?Truthfully, there are many ways you could go about it, but I would like to propose a different approach.  Let’s get to it!What are Phrasal Verbs?Phrasal Verbs are idiomatic phrases that have a verb (thus the name) and another element which is generally a preposition or an adverb. These then join together to create what is effectively a new word.Phrasal Verbs are extremely common in spoken or casual English. I’d go as far as to say that it’s extremely difficult to talk for 1 minute and not use a phrasal verb.Ironically, we do have vocabulary that mean the same as these phrasal verbs, but these words are generally considered ‘fancy’ or ‘something Shakespeare would say’. Often times, we don’t even know them!These same ‘fancy’ words then happen to exist in other languages almost verbatim, particularly in languages derived from Latin (such as Portuguese), and they are normal, everyday words!So, in summary, English speakers are just making life harder for those trying to learn English. Nice!The current methodUntil now, most approaches centre around the idea of memorizing phrasal verbs. In my view, this is essentially like learning History back when I was in school. Reading and rereading the information for those few moments in life when I am asked to repeat it again in a test.Outside of those situations, I am unlikely to remember that information. Even more so when from nowhere, I now need to use that information. It’s just lost somewhere in my brain with everything else.Highly unhelpful.To help students, most books try to group phrasal verbs by theme, or maybe a common word (phrasal verbs beginning with ‘put’ for example). This can be helpful, but then we remember that many phrasal verbs can be used in various unrelated contexts, with seemingly different definitions, and confusion takes over.Again, highly unhelpful.So, how do we deal with this? Well, I have a theory.Think outside of the box. Way outside!!The method I propose is a slow one, but ultimately more beneficial with time.When my students are learning phrasal verbs with me, I try to give them a few synonyms for the phrasal verb, and then follow that up with loads of examples.This is because through many examples we can see that, if we really think about it, there is a common thread between the various meanings. Let’s work through one.Break outHere are some seemingly unrelated uses for break out: Britney Spears was a break out star. (Meaning: one day nobody knew of her, the next day she’s world famous) Did you read those criminals broke out of prison? (Meaning: people were captive, and now free when they shouldn’t be) War suddenly broke out in Eastern Europe. (Meaning: something unexpected happened) Now, you may have already seen the common thread there, but in all those situations, something sudden and unexpected happened.Back in 1999, no normal person on the street had any meaningful expectation that a young woman from Mississippi would become a global pop sensation.Nor did anyone expect that Clarence and John Anglin would escape from Alcatraz prison.Finally, in the case of #3 anyway, the world had a belief that war could start in Ukraine, but many didn’t expect it to happen when it did.In all three of those examples, something sudden, and unexpected happened. That is the common idea and the definition of break out.They are really just new wordsIf we begin to think of phrasal verbs really as entirely new words with there own definitions, we will have a far better time learning, and then actually remembering and using them.Yes this can be annoying, and yes the fact that this is even a thing is in many ways silly. But, it is the English language and we need to love it, right?Where to from here?I would now encourage you to go pick another phrasal verb, maybe one you’re not familiar with. Research the different uses of that phrasal verb, and see if you can find that common thread.You may have to think really far outside of the box, and with an open mind, but I’m telling you the common idea is there. Once you know that, it becomes like math: you can apply the equation (phrasal verb in this case) anywhere you want as long as the logic is correct. If the logic of the phrasal verb makes sense in the context you wish to use it, then you can.Do this, and you should never use phrasal verbs incorrectly again!" }, { "title": "How to get your child started with English", "url": "/posts/how-to-get-your-child-started-with-english/", "categories": "tutorial, children", "tags": "children, beginner", "date": "2022-05-18 07:00:00 -0300", "snippet": "So, you are a young parent (I assume) and you want your child to learn English as a 2nd language.  But, you want your child to be bilingual, to have ‘native’ pronunciations, a wide vocabulary etc.  How can you do this effectively, while your child actively enjoys the process?Cartoons and other streaming content.I know, you’ve already thought of that (probably), but let’s consider what you may not have thought about already.Start earlyLike all skills, the earlier you start, the better. However, in this particular case, failure to start early may kill the entire strategy.My daughter started watching English content the day she started watching TV. This was extremely important for 2 reasons: To inject more English into her day as her whole world is effectively in Portuguese, and (more importantly) To accustomize her to the idea of watching content in multiple languages. Now when she watches Pepper Pig or Paw Patrol, she doesn’t have a language preference, as is the case with her non-English speaking cousins.Set all accounts to English by defaultIn the case of streaming services, such as Netflix, by setting the child’s account to English lanuage by default, all content will automatically play in English unless you manually override the language of that specific show.This step is key.When it comes to YouTube, things are more complicated.Firstly, I suggest having a profile/account specifically for your child. This will ensure that your child’s preferences don’t mix with your own (we don’t want them seeing anything they shouldn’t), and because you can start tailoring the kinds of videos that are recommended.This tailoring applies to both content and language.Since YouTube will by default provide content in the native language of the country you live in, you will need to train YouTube out of this habit.Search for good contentStreaming services are absolutely full of content. The probem comes in when we need to choose it.YouTube is a great resource but it can also be a curse. If your kids are already watching YouTube, you’ll be well aware of the kind of ‘influencer’ play content that exists. Most of it is utter rubbish, but since kids watch and rewatch this content blindly, YouTube will just keep putting it in front of them and then it becomes the child’s expectation.Research good educational content, preferably musical content in the early years. Cocomelon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbCmjCuTUZos6Inko4u57UQ) and Bounce Patrol are good options. Yes, they can get annoying when on repeat, but good nonetheless.Don’t forget to be a responsible parentThis I believe goes without saying, but should you be sharing this with a parent who cannot speak English and therefore maybe cannot understand the content of the show or YouTube channel, make sure to help them check it out first.Sadly, we live in a world that enables all kinds of content to be available online. The last thing we want is our children watching content that we believe is harmful to them simply because we don’t understand the content.This becomes more important as the child becomes older because, well, kids will be kids.And honestly, that’s it! Start them young, with content you are happy with, and positively reenforce this.Your child may not start producing English completely all on their own, but they will certainly understand a lot more than you may think!" } ]
